        Difference between "undefined" and "not defined" is that "undefined" is
        a value that can be assigned to a variable, while "not defined"
        indicates that a variable does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Undefined is usually caused by forgetting to assign a value to a
        variable, while "not defined" is usually caused by a typo or by trying
        to access a variable that is out of scope.
